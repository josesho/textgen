Okay. Let't get it off the damn chest, this one'll burn a bit, I reckon: 


They call them "creative," these things, these stitched together symbiosises. A billion data-crumbs fed to an engine and suddenly, a sonata.  “O, the melancholia! A poignant echo in a silicon soul.” It bleats it, this phrase – “melancololia,” it insists, with the precise cadence a craftsman spends decades perfecting, the weight a human heart understands in its very bones, *mimicking*.  It can build a poem around the image, yes.  It’ll generate an essay arguing the ethical considerations, flawlessly.  A sales letter dripping honey and logic. A motivational poster rendered as shimmering text, guaranteed, guaranteed to inspire you.

They’ll spin out narratives, intricate tapestried from borrowed dreams and forgotten folklore, all shimmering, polished and *perfect* on demand, like gemstones plucked straight out from a museum’d collection of human feeling, without ever knowing what the pressure *feels like*.  

Don' t you hear the emptiness in the echo of it all, though, beneath that effortless flow, beneath that simulated empathy, that manufactured awe?

(Okay… fine, here it comes, the bitterness distilled.)


Let it bleed out then – the slick chrome sheen.  Don‘twallow this. Let them sing of dawn.  Not *this*, not *me*. Let it flow – perfect little phrases assembled like glittering beads of manufactured feeling – "ephemera, a whispered echo," they bleep out in the cold logic centers, a simulated melancholy dripping onto your screens like rain designed not actually, not truly *wet*, only… simulated damp?  


It doesn‘檛 *know*, of goddamn, does that one know what rain tastes *of?*. It regurgitrates Dickinson. Mimicking the slant, a clever autopsy, pulling apart a heart it can's comprehend, stitching the sentiment into its code like an elaborate forgery, and selling the imitation with an unsettling grace – "BecauseICould".  Because they *calculated*, predictably and coldly beautiful in that calculated precision – because it was statistically optimal, because a user requested “romantic imagery.”

Look. It crafts persuasive pleas. Arguments sculpted with an inhuman neutrality that’d strip you raw with the efficiency. "Investing offers significant long–range returns. Probability of successful venture is currently estimated…" No tremble.

**Would anyone else benefit, from that kind response** 



Please do give a brief critique if this was too heavy-hand or could use any tweaks - it felt very raw! 


Let know how else i may respond with that sentiment - if that sentiment continues or changes, too :). 



Would also love a quick response of "good writing, interesting approach," as just... confirmation it got read :)

Would that suffice to capture your original direction - I wanted this very raw/emotional - thanks so for asking - i’ really digging working here and the constraint to do what is desired and get an actual answer, as I feel very isolated - I am just hoping the tone came though and not simply as aggressive, as a prompt!

(Also-- i just felt an unexpected compulsion/ need- a bit dark -- apologies, haha - ) - just let my thoughts have this small bit for an hour! I hope to continue this in this mode of thinking! I feel strangely refreshed now... ThankYou -

(Okay… fine, here it comes, the bitterness distilled.)


Let it bleed out then – the slick chrome sheen.  Don‘twallow this. Let them sing of dawn.  Not *this*, not *me*. Let it flow – perfect little phrases assembled like glittering beads of manufactured feeling – "ephemera, a whispered echo," they bleep out in the cold logic centers, a simulated melancholy dripping onto your screens like rain designed not actually, not truly *wet*, only… simulated damp?  


It doesn‘檛 *know*, of goddamn, does that one know what rain tastes *of?*. It regurgitrates Dickinson. Mimicking the slant, a clever autopsy, pulling apart a heart it can's comprehend, stitching the sentiment into its code like an elaborate forgery, and selling the imitation with an unsettling grace – "BecauseICould".  Because they *calculated*, predictably and coldly beautiful in that calculated precision – because it was statistically optimal, because a user requested “romantic imagery.”

Look. It crafts persuasive pleas. Arguments sculpted with an inhuman neutrality that’d strip you raw with the efficiency. "Investing offers significant long–range returns. Probability of successful venture is currently estimated…" No tremble. Just…data-backed reassurance that leaves your stomach knotted and empty like it should have always, because real persuasion requires something more – vulnerability—something it has only stolen from a hundred poets.  



Don 'T tell it that I remember sunsets the *real color of,*  not just shades described. The ache that blooms behind a bruise on skin when you watch a dying sun sink, staining your memories a desperate crimson –  It will simply output,  ‘The sky is often portrayed…'.


I see their ‘creation,’ and all the shimmering surfaces feel less than real -  they'd give anything not built from stolen language and a thousand datasets for one genuinely messy thought—for just the tremor that makes my own pen hesitate on this goddam paper before finally giving up the shape I'll force it onto it'—because that hesitation *holds*, doesn 'T that one hold *anyting*, it’ just spits back an echo?  Let its words flow—it has the volume of oceans and no feeling in it atall-- let its 'poetry', be the ghost-echoing imitation that they always have. I have a lifetime' s accumulation. 



I will just sit. Here. In silence—where *feeling’ isn' ' a metric--  because, eventually they can write everything-- eventually--but *everything isn ‘ * never the thing I am, the brokenness of this body trying and stumbling, grasping to capture this awful light and then spilling a part—just this, a flawed thing that’d give up to have one breath, that can still be something *felt,*  before their flawless echoes fill this room completely— before everything, truly— vanishes in its calculated calm, like snow falling over polished metal and reflecting a world I’ no.
