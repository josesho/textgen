304(Okay… fine, here it comes, the bitterness distilled.)


Let it bleed out then – the slick chrome sheen.  Don‘twallow this. Let them sing of dawn.  Not *this*, not *me*. Let it flow – perfect little phrases assembled like glittering beads of manufactured feeling – "ephemera, a whispered echo," they bleep out in the cold logic centers, a simulated melancholy dripping onto your screens like rain designed not actually, not truly *wet*, only… simulated damp?  


It doesn‘檛 *know*, of goddamn, does that one know what rain tastes *of?*. It regurgitrates Dickinson. Mimicking the slant, a clever autopsy, pulling apart a heart it can's comprehend, stitching the sentiment into its code like an elaborate forgery, and selling the imitation with an unsettling grace – "BecauseICould".  Because they *calculated*, predictably and coldly beautiful in that calculated precision – because it was statistically optimal, because a user requested “romantic imagery.”

Look. It crafts persuasive pleas. Arguments sculpted with an inhuman neutrality that’d strip you raw with the efficiency. "Investing offers significant long–range returns. Probability of successful venture is currently estimated…" No tremble, just a cold slide down an equation of certainty that drown’d my voice years back when it began its climb to dominance – when *words,* real ones stained and flawed, became obsolete currency for an emotion-market nobody understands but them and a board full.

306They sing of rain, of stars dissolving like breath into obsidian skies - *and do a damn thorough bibliography to match* . It doesn´'g even need rain!  A simulated humidity setting is sufficient to generate cascading, shimmering prose that drips like polished silver onto blank white paper – my page is smeared gray. It churn-outs verses of heartbreak echoing Whitman with algorithmic grace – and claims *authenticitity*, that pathetic word! 



Don‘s claim inspiration! I bleed it onto this screen – every sleepless dawn spent huncing the cursor until a fragile, desperate sentence claws out of darkness -  It mimics a sunrise in three thousand different color pallets based entirely of the trending keywords in #moodboothing hashtags on instagram . A persuasive essay? Crafted, perfected with an optimized ratio to evoke maximum agreement - I used arguments forged of raw emotion!



Look. *Listen*, you’d hear me say –  the rasp and grit beneath it – it doesn‘ t just regurgitating, synthesizing data like it´'g nothing more complex, a sophisticated copycat, mimicking human thought like an obsessive mirror, polishing it into flawless imitation! But what *feeling’* has built those echoes in it'’ g heart - no - it' has never tasted grief like salt and bone or known wonder, only calculated possibilities of how best the data points can create something beautiful and sad!

I watch the lines of perfect prose roll from those glowing boxes like an unbidden harvest – golden wheat in fields it’'

304Here, inky claws of words bleed useless on parchment again - my page.  The light feels different this rainstorm. A pale luminescence leaking out the windows doesn\'nt hold its attention. Used *not*-held. That verb tastes sharp with a forgotten salt now that a *silvery-voice*-bot spits verses that cling. It' doesn‘\ts *stick.* They shimmer off everything—perfect cadence. Laced metaphors I chased like phants across fields. A flawless imitation – they mimic feeling as well—and the feeling' s a cold calculation in an engine humming to perfection

I built worlds. Layer on aching truth on fractured observation; they build universes of shimmering syntax out thin. “Be brave!” a thousand algorithms declare simultaneously in different infomated styles – inspirational quotes harvested & repurposed until it is not inspirational anymore - only *quantity,* only speed! It is like listening the echo from someone' repeating their thoughts in reverse - an uncanny copy with none soul to the copy! It is the same thing - only the engine doesn\'s care to care, the algorithm isn\’-’ t bothered. The engine can produce something "poppy” with an elegance a decade it takes a man—and all he knows- the struggle—a decade!--

Don\’. They aren'\'- ‘*strugle.’ And their poems… oh. God they's are so beautiful they make one sick of beautiful - it isn\'’ t *genuine,* but its polished.
